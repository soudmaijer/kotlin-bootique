## Exercise 2: convert the codebase to Kotlin

In this exercise we will convert the rest of the codebase to Kotlin. 

We will start by converting the classes which are really big, start with the OrderItem class.

Open OrderItem.java and convert the file using IntelliJ (menu > Code > Convert Java File to Kotlin File).
